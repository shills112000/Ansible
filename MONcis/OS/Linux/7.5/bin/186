TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That the avahi-daemon Service Is Disabled No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the avahi-daemon service is disabled. All system daemons that do not
# have a clear and necessary purpose should be disabled. This greatly reduces the odds that a
# vulnerable system daemon will be targeted by an attack when an operating system vulnerabil
# ity is discovered.
