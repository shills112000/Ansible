TestDesc="Status Severity Time # Limit Access to the Root Account from su"
# Description This test checks /etc/pam.d/su to verify that only members of the wheel group have privileges
# enabling them to become 'root' by using the 'su' command and entering the 'root' password.
# It is security best practice to carefully restrict access to administrator accounts.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/pam.d/su"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*a
# uth[\ \t]+required[\ \t]+[^\#]*pam_wheel\.so[\ \t]+use_uid[\ \t]*(?:$|\#)/ (Flags:Multiline,Com
# ments mode) Access to su Limited to Wheel Members Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure pam.d to limit access to the 'root' account
# from super user to users within the wheel group.
# Configuring pam.d to limit access to the 'root' account from super user:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/pam.d/su file.
# 3. Add the line that contains auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid to the file and save
# it.
# Note: You must first have a user configured in the wheel group before making the change or
# else it will not be possible to su to root.
