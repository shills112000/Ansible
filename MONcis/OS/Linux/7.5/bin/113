TestDesc="Verify That Users Are Assigned Valid Home Directories"
# Directories
# No Results 0
# Description The /etc/passwd file defines a home directory that the user is placed in upon login. If the user'
# s home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/" and will not be
# able to write any files or have local environment variables set.
# Rules User Home Directories
# Element Equals "User Home Directories"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^[\\t]*U
# serName=(?!nfsnobody[\ \t])\S+[\ \t]+UserID=(?:[1-9]\d{3}|0*\d{5,})[\ \t]+(?:UserHome=[\ \t]+P

# signed Valid Home Directories Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, assign valid home directory for all normal users.
# Assigning valid home directory for all normal users:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the following command to list all user that not be a valid home directory:
# Users=`/bin/cat /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null | /bin/egrep -v "^[[:space:]]*(#.*|\+.*|nfsnobody):" | /bin/awk -F: '$3 >=1000 {print}'`; 
# SavedIFS="$IFS"; IFS=`/bin/echo -en "\n\b"`; for User in $Users; do UserName=`echo $User | /bin/awk -F: '{print $1}'`;
# UserHome=`/bin/echo $User | /bin/awk -F: '{print $6}'`; if [ "$UserHome" != "/" ]; then if [ ! -d "$UserHome" ]; then /bin/echo $UserName ;
# fi; fi; done; IFS="$SavedIFS"
# 3. Run the usermod -d <home_directory> <user_name> command to assign a home
# directory for users found in the step 2.
