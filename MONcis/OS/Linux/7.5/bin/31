TestDesc="Description This test verifies that passwords cannot be reused until at least 5 changes have been made."
# Preventing users from reusing passwords makes it more difficult for attackers to gain access
# to the system.
# Rules Verify Password Reuse Setting in /etc/pam.d/system-auth File
# Element Equals "Password_Reuse"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*p
# assword[\ \t]+[^\#\n]*\bpam_unix\.so[\ \t]+[^\#\n]*\bremember=(?:[^0-4]|\d{2,})\b.*$|^[\ \t]*p
# assword[\ \t]+[^\#\n]*\bpam_pwhistory\.so\b(?![^\#\n]*\bremember=[0-4]\b).*$/ (Flags:Multilin
# e,Comments mode) Password Reuse Setting Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the 'remember' option and create /etc/securi
# ty/opasswd file in order to prevent users from reusing the last 5 old passwords.
# Setting the 'remember' option and creating /etc/security/opasswd file in order to pre
# vent users from reusing the last 5 old passwords:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the touch /etc/security/opasswd command to create the /etc/security/opass
# wd file if it does not exist.
# 3. Open the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file.
# 4. Find the line that contains password <control_flag>[security_path/]pam_unix.so
# [parameters] or password <control_flag>[security_path/]pam_pwhistory.so [pa
# rameters] .
# • If one of the lines is found, then find remember=<value> parameter.
# o If the parameter is found, set the <value> to 5 or greater.
# o If the parameter is not found, add the parameter remember=<value>
# to the line where <value> is set to 5 or greater.
# • If none of the lines is found, review the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file, then edit
# or add some entries if needed to make sure that the file contains the following
# ordered lines:
# password sufficient [security_path/]pam_unix.so remem
# ber=<value> [other parameters]
# or
# password required [security_path/]pam_pwhistory.so
# remember=<value> [other parameters]
# password sufficient [security_path/]pam_unix.so [param
# eters]
# where the <value> is set to 5 or greater.
# 5. Save the file.
