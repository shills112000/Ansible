TestDesc="Verify That the /var/tmp Directory Is Bound to the /tmp Directory"
# No Results 0
# Description The /var/tmp directory is normally a standalone directory in the /var file system. Binding /var/
# tmp to /tmp establishes an unbreakable link to /tmp that cannot be removed (even by the root
# user). It also allows /var/tmp to inherit the same mount options that /tmp owns, allowing /var/
# tmp to be protected in the same /tmp is protected. It will also prevent /var from filling up with
# temporary files as the contents of /var/tmp will actually reside in the file system containing /
# tmp.

# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, bind mount the /var/tmp directory to /tmp.
# Binding mount the /var/tmp directory to /tmp:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run following command:
# mount --bind /tmp /var/tmp
# 3. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 4. Edit the file to contain the following line:
# /tmp /var/tmp none bind 0 0
# 5. Save file to apply the change.
# For further details, please run the command man fstab to read man page.
