TestDesc=" Verify That SELinux Meets or Exceeds the Default"
# fault Targeted Policy
# No Results 0
# Description Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a policy
# that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is intended to
# ensure that at least the default recommendations are met.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/selinux/config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^SELIN
# UXTYPE=[\ \t]*targeted[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) SELinux Type Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, ensure that SELinux is enabled at boot time.
# To ensure that SELinux is enabled at boot time:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/selinux/config file.
# 3. Find the line SELINUXTYPE=<parameter>.
# 4. If found, then set <parameter> to targeted and save the file.
# 5. If not found, then add the SELINUXTYPE=targeted line to the file and save it.
# 6. Reboot to apply the change.
