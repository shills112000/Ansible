TestDesc="Verify Default umask for Users in /etc/profile.d/*"
# Description This test verifies that the default umask in /etc/profile.d/* is set to 077. The umask value influ
# ences the permissions assigned to files when they are created. A misconfigured umask value
# could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unautho
# rized users.
# Rules umask in /etc/profile.d/*
# Element Equals "/etc/profile.d/*"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^.*not[\
# \t]+set.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) Default umask Setting Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the default umask to 077 for global initialization
# files.
# Setting the default umask to 077 for global initialization files:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the following command:
# for FileName in /etc/profile.d/*; do if [ ! "`/bin/egrep '^[[:space:]]*u
# mask[[:space:]]*0*77[[:space:]]*($|#)' $FileName 2>/dev/null`" ];
# then /bin/echo $FileName; fi ;done
# to list the files that do not contain the umask 077.
# 3. Open each file listed in step 2, find the line that contains the umask <value> line.
# • If found, replace the <value> to 077.
# • If not found, add the line umask 077 to the file.
# 4. Close and save the file.
# For further details, please run the command man 2 umask to read man page.
