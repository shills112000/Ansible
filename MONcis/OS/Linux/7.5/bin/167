TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That rsyslog Service Is Enabled No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that rsyslog service is enabled. The security enhancements of rsyslog such
# as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats,
# and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and config
# uring the package.
