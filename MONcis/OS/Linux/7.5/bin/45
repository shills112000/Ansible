TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/cron.weekly Permissions No Results 0"
# Description The /etc/cron.weekly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a weekly basis.
# The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead
# edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write
# and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this direc
# tory.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/cron.weekly"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Pass User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\
# \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^d.{3}-{6}.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# cron.weekly directory.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/cron.weekly directory:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Check the permissions and ownership of the file using the ls -ld /etc/cron.weekly
# command.
# 3. Change permissions to 700 or more restrictive using the chmod go-rwx /etc/cron.
# weekly command.
# 4. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/cron.weekly com
# mand.
