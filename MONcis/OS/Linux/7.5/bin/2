TestDesc="Status Severity Time Find All Unowned Directories and Files"
# Description This test checks for the presence of unowned directories and files on the file system.
# Any unowned directories and files found on the file system should be carefully reviewed by
# the system administrator. Unowned directories and files may be an indication of unauthorized
# system access or improper package maintenance/installation.
# Rules Find All Unowned Files
# Element Equals "Unowned Files"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /.+/
# (Flags:Case insensitive) Unowned Files Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate ownership on the directories and un
# owned files.
# Setting appropriate ownership on the directories and unowned files:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# PARTs=`/bin/df --local -P 2>/dev/null | /bin/egrep -v "/dev/sr0" | /
# bin/awk 'NR != 1 {$1="";$2="";$3="";$4="";$5="";gsub("^[[:spac
# e:]]+/","/",$0);print $0}' 2>/dev/null`; SaveIFS=$IFS;IFS=`/bin/echo
# -e "\n\b"`; for PART in $PARTs; do /usr/bin/find "$PART" -xdev \( -
# nouser -o -nogroup \) -print 2>/dev/null; done; IFS=$SaveIFS
# to list all directories and unowned files.
# 3. Check the ownership of the above directories and files using the /bin/ls -ldL <file
# _location> command.
# 4. Change ownership using the /bin/chown <user_owner>:<group_owner> <file
# _location> command if needed.
