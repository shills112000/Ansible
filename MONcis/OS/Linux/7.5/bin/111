TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That Unconfined Daemons Are Disabled No Results 0"
# Description Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their parent
# process. Since daemons are launched and descend from the init process, they will inherit the
# security context label initrc_t. This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the pro
# cess more permission than it requires.
# Rules Get Unconfined Daemons
# Element Equals "Get Unconfined Daemons"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /.+/
# (Flags:Case insensitive) Unconfined Daemons Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, check for unconfined daemons.
# Checking for unconfined daemons:
# 1. Perform the following to determine if unconfined daemons are running on the system:
# ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk"
# 2. Investigate any unconfined daemons found in step 1.
# 3. Using the following command to kill daemon process that you want to kill:
# kill -9 <PID>
# <PID> that is PID of process that list in second column in step 1.

	echo " Investigate any unconfined daemons found in step 1."
	echo " Using Kill -9 PID command to kill daemon process that you want to kill:"
	echo ""
	exit $?

	echo "Everything ok - no unconfined processes found"
