TestDesc=" Status Severity Time Verify Warning Banners in /etc/issue.net Do Not Contain OS Information"
# Description This test determines if the banner configured in /etc/issue.net contains information that would
# indicate the type of operating system.
# Removal of operating system information from login banners helps to prevent attackers from
# targeting OS vulnerabilities.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/issue.net"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /\\m|\\r|\
# \s|\\v/ System Information Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the banners to create warnings for network
# and physical access services in the /etc/issue.net file.
# Configuring the banners for console access in the /etc/issue.net file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/issue.net file.
# 3. Remove system information such as: \m \r \s \v from the above file if they are present
# and save it.
