TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That .rhosts Files Do Not Exist No Results 0"
# Description This test determines if any .rhosts files are present on the system. These files may contain un
# encrypted passwords which could be used to attack other systems. Examine the list of files
# found by this policy test very carefully and identify application dependencies and user impact
# before removing anything.
# Rules User Dot Files
# Element Equals "User Dot Files"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^.*/\.rho
# sts$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) .rhosts File Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, remove the .rhosts files in the user home directories.
# Removing the .rhosts files in the user home directories:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# Users=`/bin/egrep -v "^[[:space:]]*#|^[[:space:]]*$" /etc/passwd
# 2>/dev/null | /bin/awk -F: '{ cmd = "/usr/bin/passwd -S " $1 " 2>/
# dev/null"; cmd | getline UserInfo; if ($0 !~ /^[[:space:]]*(#.*|\+.*|
# root|halt|sync|shutdown):/ && (UserInfo ~ /^[[:graph:]]+[[:spac
# e:]]+PS[[:space:]]+/ || (UserInfo ~ /^[[:space:]]*Unknown[[:sp
# ace:]]+user\./ && $2 != "!!")) && $7 !~ /^\/sbin\/nologin$/){ print
# $1 ":" $6}}'`; SavedIFS="$IFS"; IFS=`/bin/echo -e "\n\b"`; for User
# in $Users; do UserName=`/bin/echo "$User" | /bin/awk -F: '{print
# $1}'`; HomeDirectory=`/bin/echo "$User" | /bin/awk -F: '{print $2}'`
# ; /bin/ls -alL $HomeDirectory/.rhosts 2>/dev/null | awk '$1 !~ /^d/
# { FileName=substr($0,index($0,"/")); print UserName, $1, $3, $4,
# FileName}' UserName="$UserName"; done; IFS="$SavedIFS";
# to list all .rhosts files.
# 3. Remove .rhosts files found in step 2 using the rm -f <.rhosts_file_name> command.
# For further details, please run the command man rm to read man page.
