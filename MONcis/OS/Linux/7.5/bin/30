TestDesc="Description This test verifies that the system is configured to use a minimum password length of 14 characters."
# Using longer passwords hinders the ability of an attacker to use brute-force methods to try to
# gain access to the system.
# Rules Get /etc/pam.d/system-auth Content
# Element Equals "/etc/pam.d/system-auth_content"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*p
# assword[\ \t]+(?:requisite|required)[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bpam_cracklib\.so[\ \t]+[^\#\n]*\bminlen=(
# \d+)\b.*/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) Minimum of Password Length Setting Greater than
# or equal 14
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the required minimum acceptable size for the new
# password to at least 14 characters.
# Setting the minimum acceptable size for the new password to at least 14 characters:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file.
# 3. Find the line that contains:
# password <control_flag> [security_path/]pam_cracklib.so [param
# eters]
# where the <control flag> is requisite or required.
# 4. If the line is found, find the parameter minlen=<value>:
# • If the parameter is found, set the <value> to 14 or greater.
# • If the parameter is not found, add the parameter minlen=<value> to the line
# where the <value> is set to 14 or greater.
# 5. If the line is not found, then review the file, then edit or add some entries if needed to
# make sure that the file contains the following ordered lines:
# password requisite [security_path/]pam_cracklib.so minlen=<va
# lue> [other parameters]
# password sufficient [security_path/]pam_unix.so use_authtok
# [other parameters]
# password required [security_path/]pam_deny.so
# where the <value> is set to 14 or greater.
# 6. Save the file.
