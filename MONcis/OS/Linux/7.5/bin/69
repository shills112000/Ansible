TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That 'nodev' Option Is Added to /tmp Partition in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices. Since
# the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users can
# not attempt to create block or character special devices in /tmp.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+/tmp[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bnodev\b.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments
# mode) /tmp with nodev Option Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set nodev option for /tmp partition.
# Setting nodev option for /tmp partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /tmp.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition
# for /tmp then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the nodev option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount,nodev /tmp command.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
