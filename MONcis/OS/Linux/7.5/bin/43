TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/cron.hourly Permissions No Results 0"
# Description This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on an hourly basis. The files in this
# directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system
# administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access
# to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/cron.hourly"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Pass User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\
# \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^d.{3}-{6}.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# cron.hourly directory.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/cron.hourly directory:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Check the permissions and ownership of the file using the ls -ld /etc/cron.hourly
# command.
# 3. Change permissions to 700 or more restrictive using the chmod go-rwx /etc/cron.
# hourly command.
# 4. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/cron.hourly com
# mand.
