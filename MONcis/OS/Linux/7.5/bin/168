TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That sshd_config Contains 'LogLevel INFO' No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the local SSH server contains 'LogLevel INFO'. The option LogLevel
# specifies the level that is used when logging messages from sshd.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*L
# ogLevel[\ \t]+(\w+)[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) (LogLevel Equals "INFO" AND
# SSH Server LogLevel Setting Exists ) OR SSH Server LogLevel Setting Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the verbosity level that is used when logging mes
# sages from sshd to INFO.
# Setting the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from sshd to INFO:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
# 3. Find the line that contains LogLevel <value>.
# 4. Set the <value> to INFO and save the file.
# 5. Run the service sshd restart command to apply the change.
# For further details, please run the command man sshd_config to read man page.
