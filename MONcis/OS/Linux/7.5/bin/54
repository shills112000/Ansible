TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/passwd File Permissions No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the 'root' user and 'root' group owns the /etc/passwd file and permissions
# are equal to 644 or more restrictive.
# Setting the recommended permissions allows users to view the file, but only 'root' has write
# access.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/passwd"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Pass User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^-.
# {2}-.-{2}.-{2}.*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# passwd file.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/passwd file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Check the permissions and ownership of the file using the ls -lL /etc/passwd com
# mand.
# 3. Change permissions to 644 or more restrictive using the chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/pass
# wd command.
# 4. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/passwd command.
