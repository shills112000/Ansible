TestDesc=" Verify That at Least One of AllowUsers, AllowGroups, DenyUsers, DenyGroups Option Is Leveraged"
# No Results 0
# Description There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via
# SSH. It is recommended that at least of the following options be leveraged: AllowUsers, Allow
# Groups, DenyUsers, DenyGroups.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*(
# ?:AllowUsers|AllowGroups|DenyUsers|DenyGroups)[\ \t]+\w+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insen
# sitive,Comments mode) Access via SSH Setting Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the SSH server to limit which users and
# group can access the system via SSH.
# Configuring the SSH server to limit which users and group can access the system via
# SSH:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
# 3. Adding at least of the following options:
# AllowUsers <user_list>
# AllowGroups <group_list>
# DenyUsers <user_list>
# DenyGroups <group_list>
# where <user_list> and <group_list> is a list of user name or group name patterns,
# separated by comma.
# 4. Save the file.
# 5. Run the pkill -HUP sshd or /sbin/service sshd restart commands to restart the
# sshd service.
# For further details, please run the command man sshd_config to read man page.
