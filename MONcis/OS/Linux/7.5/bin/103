TestDesc=" Verify That SELinux Is Enabled at Boot Time"
# Description SELinux must be enabled at boot time in to ensure that the controls it provides are in effect at
# all times.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/selinux/config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^SELIN
# UX=(?i:enforcing).*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) Setting SELINUX to enforcing Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, ensure that SELinux is enabled at boot time.
# To ensure that SELinux is enabled at boot time :
# Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 1. Open the /etc/selinux/config file.
# 2. Find the line SELINUX=<parameter>.
# 3. If found, then set <parameter> to enforcing and save the file.
# 4. If not found, then add the SELINUX=enforcing line to the file and save it.
# 5. Reboot to apply the change.
