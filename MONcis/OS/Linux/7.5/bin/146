TestDesc=" Verify That gpgcheck Is Globally Activated "
# No Results 0
# Description The gpgcheck option, found in the main section of the /etc/yum.conf file determines if an RPM
# package's signature is always checked prior to its installation. It is important to ensure that an
# RPM's package signature is always checked prior to installation to ensure that the software is
# obtained from a trusted source.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/yum.conf"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*g
# pgcheck=0[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) gpgcheck Option Devia

# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set gpgcheck is globally activated.
# Setting gpgcheck is globally activated:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/yum.conf file.
# 3. Find the line gpgcheck=<value>.
# 4. If found, then set <value> to 1 and save the file.
# 5. If not found, then add the gpgcheck=1 line under [main] section in yum.conf file and
# save it.
# For further details, please run command man yum.conf to read the manual page.
