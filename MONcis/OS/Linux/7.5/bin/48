TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/gshadow Permissions No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the 'root' user owns /etc/gshadow and permissions are equal to 000.
# It is worthwhile to periodically check these file permissions as there have been package de
# fects that changed /etc/gshadow permissions to 000.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/gshadow"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Pass User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\
# \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^-{10}.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# gshadow file.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/gshadow file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Check the permissions and ownership of the file using the ls -lL /etc/gshadow com
# mand.
# 3. Change permissions to 000 using the chmod 000 /etc/gshadow command.
# 4. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/gshadow command.
