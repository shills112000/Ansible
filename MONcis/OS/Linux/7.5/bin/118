TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That a /var/log Partition Is in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data. There are two important
# reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate partition: protection against re
# source exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and protection of audit data.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[^\#\n]*[\
# \t]+/var/log[\ \t]+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /var/log Entry Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, create a separate partition for /var/log.
# Creating a separate partition for /var/log:
# 1. For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create
# a separate partition for /var/log.
# 2. For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
# to create partitions.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
