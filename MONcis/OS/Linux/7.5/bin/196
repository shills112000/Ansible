TestDesc="Verify That the ntp Daemon Is Running as an Unprivileged User"
# Unprivileged User
# No Results 0
# Description The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize system clocks across a variety
# of systems and use a source that is highly accurate. It is recommended that physical systems
# and virtual guests lacking direct access to the physical host's clock be configured as NTP
# clients to synchronize their clocks (especially to support time sensitive security mechanisms
# like Kerberos). This also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
# which aids in forensic investigations.

# Remediation To remediate the failure of this policy test, set user parameters to ensure that NTP daemon is
# running as an unprivileged user.
# Setting user parameters to ensure that NTP daemon is running as an unprivileged user:
# 1. Become a superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. If ntp account and ntp group dedicated to unprivileged user doesn't exist, add them to
# system:
# • Run the following command to add new group: groupadd <group_name> -g
# <value>
# • Run the following command to add new account: useradd <account_name> -
# s /usr/sbin/nologin -u <value> -g <value>
# Note: The <value> in the above commands is userid and groupid, you
# can choose any number which is less than 500 and not duplicated with
# another userid - groupid.
# 3. Open /etc/sysconfig/ntpd file.
# 4. Find the line that contains OPTIONS entry.
# 5. Uncomment or change it to OPTIONS="-u ntp:ntp -p /var/run/ntpd.pid" or add if not
# found.
# 6. Save and close the file.
# For further details, please run the command man ntpd to read man page.
