TestDesc=" Verify That a /var/log/audit Partition Is in the /etc/fstab File"
# No Results 0
# Description The /var/log/audit directory is used to store log data created the auditing daemon, auditd.
# There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate parti
# tion: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and protection
# of audit data.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[^\#\n]*[\
# \t]+/var/log/audit[\ \t]+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /var/log/audit Entry Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, create separate a partition for /var/log/audit.
# Creating a separate partition for /var/log/audit:
# 1. For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create
# a separate partition for /var/log/audit.
# 2. For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
# to create partitions.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
