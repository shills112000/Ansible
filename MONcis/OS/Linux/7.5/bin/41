TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/cron.d Permissions No Results 0"
# Description The /etc/cron.d directory contains system cron jobs that need to run in a similar manner to the
# hourly, daily weekly and monthly jobs from /etc/crontab, but require more granular control as
# to when they run. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command,
# but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below re
# strict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from ac
# cessing this directory.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/cron.d"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Pass User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\
# \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^d.{3}-{6}.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# cron.d directory.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/cron.d directory:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Check the permissions and ownership of the directory using the ls -ldL /etc/cron.d
# command.
# 3. Change permissions to 700 or more restrictive using the chmod go-rwx /etc/cron.d
# command.
# 4. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/cron.d command.
