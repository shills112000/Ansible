TestDesc=" Verify That the /etc/ssh/sshd_config File Contains 'MaxAuthTries'"
# tains 'MaxAuthTries'
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file contains 'MaxAuthTries'. The MaxAuthTries
# option determines the maximum number of login attempts per connection. MaxAuthTries
# should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*M
# axAuthTries[\ \t]+(\d+)[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) SSH MaxAu
# thTries Greater than 0 AND SSH MaxAuthTries Less than or equal 4
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, limit the maximum number of authentication attempts
# which are permitted per connection at 4.
# Limiting the maximum number of authentication attempts which are permitted per con
# nection at 4:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
# 3. Find the line that contains MaxAuthTries <value>.
# 4. Set <value> to 4 or less and greater than 0 then save the file.
# 5. Run the pkill -HUP sshd or /sbin/service sshd restart commands to restart the
# sshd service.
# For further details, please run the command man sshd_config to read man page.
