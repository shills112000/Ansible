TestDesc=" That rsyslog Is Configured to SendLogs to a Remote Log Host"
# Logs to a Remote Log Host
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that rsyslogd is configured to send logs to a remote loghost.
# Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains
# root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on
# the local system
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/rsyslog.conf"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*
# \*\.\*[\ \t]+(?:@|:omrelp:)\S+[\ \t]*(?:$|\#)/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode)
# Send Logs to a Remote Log Host Setting Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the /etc/rsyslog.conf file to send logs to a re
# mote log host.
# Configuring the /etc/rsyslog.conf file to send logs to a remote log host:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/rsyslog.conf file.
# 3. Review the file:
# • Add the following to the file if the system uses UDP for log message delivery:
# *.* @[loghost.example.com]
# • Add the following to the file if the system uses TCP for log message delivery:
# *.* @@[loghost.example.com]
# • Add the following to the file if the system uses RELP for log message delivery:
# *.* :omrelp:[loghost.example.com]
# where [loghost.example.com] is a remote log host.
# 4. Run the service rsyslog restart command to apply changes.
# For further details, please refer to:
