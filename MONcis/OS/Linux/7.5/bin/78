TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That /dev/shm Partition Mounted with 'noexec' No Results 0"
# Description Set noexec on the shared memory partition to prevent programs from executing from there
# . Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from shared
# memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious software on the system.
# Rules File Systems Mounted
# Element Equals "File Systems Mounted"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+on[\ \t]+/dev/shm[\ \t]+type[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+\([^\#&&\S]*\bnoexec\b.*\).*$/
# (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /dev/shm with noexec Option Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set noexec option for /dev/shm partition.
# Setting noexec option for /dev/shm partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /dev/shm.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition for
# /dev/shm, then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the noexec option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount,noexec /dev/shm command.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
