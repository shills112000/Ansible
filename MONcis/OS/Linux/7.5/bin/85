TestDesc="Verify That /tmp Partition Mounted with 'no suid' No Results 0"
# Description The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain set userid files. Since
# the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that
# users cannot create set userid files in /tmp.
# Rules File Systems Mounted
# Element Equals "File Systems Mounted"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+on[\ \t]+/tmp[\ \t]+type[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+\([^\#&&\S]*\bnosuid\b.*\).*$/ (Flag
# s:Multiline,Comments mode) /tmp with nosuid Option Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set nosuid option for /tmp partition.
# Setting nosuid option for /tmp partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /tmp.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition for
# /tmp, then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the nosuid option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp command.

# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
