TestDesc="Status Severity Time For 32 Bit Architecture: Verify That audit Logging Is Enabled on the Events to Initialize or Delete Modules No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that /etc/audit/audit.rules contains the '-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_
# module -S delete_module -k modules' option.
# It is important to maintain an audit trail in order to thoroughly track and analyze system activity
# when something goes wrong.

# Configuring system to audit the loading and unloading of kernel modules on RHEL 5,
# 6:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/audit/audit.rules file.
# 3. Find the line that contains the -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module -S delet
# e_module -k modules entry.
# 4. Uncomment that line or add if not found and save the file.
# 5. Run the service auditd restart command to apply the change.
