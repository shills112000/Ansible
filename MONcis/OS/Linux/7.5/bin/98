# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that no legacy '+' entries exist in /etc/shadow. At one time, '+' entries were
# employed as markers for systems to insert data from NIS maps. These entries can serve as a
# way for attackers to gain privileged access on the system, and should be removed if they ex
# ist.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/shadow"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*\
# +.*/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) Legacy '+' Entries Does not exist
