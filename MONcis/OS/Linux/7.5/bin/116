TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That a /tmp Partition Is in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and
# some applications. Creating a separate partition for /tmp avoids a risk of resource exhaustion.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[^\#\n]*[\
# \t]+/tmp[\ \t]+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /tmp Entry Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, create separate a partition for /tmp.
# Creating a separate partition for /tmp:
# 1. For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create
# a separate partition for /tmp.
# 2. For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
# to create partitions.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
