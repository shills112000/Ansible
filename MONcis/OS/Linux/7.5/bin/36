TestDesc="Status Severity Time User Home Directories Should Be Mode 750 or More Restrictive No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that user home directories are not group-writable and only members of the
# same group have read and execute access.
# This reduces the risk posed by malicious users and allows for users to define access control
# at their discretion. Carefully consider the impact that any configuration changes to home direc
# tory permissions will have in your environment.
# Rules User Home Directories Permissions
# Element Equals "User Home Directories Permissions"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*d

# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions on user home directories.
# Setting appropriate permissions on user home directories:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# Users=`/bin/cat /etc/shadow 2>/dev/null | /bin/sort -u | /bin/egrep
# -v "^[[:space:]]*(#.*|\+.*|root|halt|sync|shutdown):" | /bin/awk -
# F: '$2 !~ /^(\*|\!|\!\!|\!\*)$/ {print $1}'`; for User in $Users; do User
# Home=`/bin/awk -F: '$1 ~ /^'$User'$/ && $7 != "/sbin/nologin" {p
# rint $6}' /etc/passwd`; if [ "$UserHome" != "/" ]; then /bin/ls -ldL
# "$UserHome" 2>/dev/null | /bin/awk '$1 !~ /d....-.---/ {print $1,$NF}';
# fi; done;
# to list user home directories which have inappropriate permissions.
# 3. Set permissions on user home directories found in step 2 to 750 or more restrictive
# using the chmod g-w,o-rwx <user_home_directory> command.
