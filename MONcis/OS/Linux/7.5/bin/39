TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify /etc/at.allow Permissions No Results 0"
# Description The at daemon works with the cron daemon to allow non-privileged users to submit one time
# only jobs at their convenience. There are two files that control at: /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.de
# ny. If /etc/at.allow exists, then users listed in the file are the only ones that can create at jobs.
# If /etc/at.allow does not exist and /etc/at.deny does exist, then any user on the system, with
# the exception of those listed in /etc/at.deny, are allowed to execute at jobs. An empty /etc/
# at.deny file allows any user to create at jobs. If neither /etc/at.allow nor /etc/at.deny exist, then
# only superuser can create at jobs. The commands below remove the /etc/at.deny file and cre
# ate an empty /etc/at.allow file that can only be read and modified by user and group root.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/at.allow"
# Version conditions Action if missing:Fail User Matches "^root[\ \t]+\(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Group Matches "^root[\ \t]+
# \(\d+\)[\ \t]*$" AND Permissions Matches "^-.{2}-{7}.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/
# at.allow file.
# Setting appropriate permissions and ownership on the /etc/at.allow file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the touch /etc/at.allow command to create the /etc/at.allow file if it does not ex
# ist.
# 3. Check the permissions and ownership of the file using the ls -lL /etc/at.allow com
# mand.
# 4. Change permissions to 600 or more restrictive using the chmod u-x,go-rwx /etc/
# at.allow command.
# 5. Change ownership to root:root using the chown root:root /etc/at.allow command.
