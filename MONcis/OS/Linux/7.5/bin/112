TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That User Accounts Are Locked Out after 35 Days of Inactivity No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that user accounts are locked out after 35 days of inactivity. Inactive ac
# counts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to notice failed login
# attempts or other anomalies.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/default/useradd"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^INAC
# TIVE=[\ \t]*(-?\d+)$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) INACTIVE Setting Less than or equal
# 35 AND INACTIVE Setting Greater than or equal 0
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the INACTIVE parameter to 35 or less but no less
# than 0.
# Setting the INACTIVE parameter to 35 or less but no less than 0:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the useradd -D -f <value> command to set the INACTIVE parameter where
# <value> is less than or equal to 35 and greater than or equal to 0.
# For further details, please run the command man useradd to read man page.
