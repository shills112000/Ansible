TestDesc="Verify That retry Option Is Set to 3 or Less"
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that the system is configured to allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
# Rules Get /etc/pam.d/system-auth Content
# Element Equals "/etc/pam.d/system-auth_content"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*p
# assword[\ \t]+(?:requisite|required)[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bpam_cracklib\.so[\ \t]+[^\#\n]*\bretry=[1
# -3]\b.*$|^[\ \t]*password[\ \t]+(?:requisite|required)[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bpam_cracklib\.so[\ \t](?![^\#
# \n]*\bretry=).*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) retry Setting Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the retry option to less than or equal to 3.
# Setting the retry option to less than or equal to 3:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file.
# 3. Find the line that contains:
# password <control flag> [security_path/]pam_cracklib.so [other
# parameters]
# where the <control flag> is required or requisite.
# 4. If the line is found, set the retry option to less than or equal to 3.
# • If the line is not found, review the file then edit or add some entries if needed
# to make sure that the file contains the following ordered lines:
# password requisite [security_path/]pam_cracklib.so
# [other parameters] retry=<value>
# password sufficient [security_path/]pam_unix.so [pa
# rameters]
# password required [security_path/]pam_deny.so
# where <value> is less than or equal to 3.
# • Save the file.
