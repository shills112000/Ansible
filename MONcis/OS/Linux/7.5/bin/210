TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That wheel Is a Group of root and Other Users"
# Description This test checks 'wheel' is a group of root and users in /etc/group.
# The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has
# been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Nor
# mally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so
# statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to exe
# cute su.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/group"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*w
# heel:[^:]+:\d+:(\S+)$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) wheel Group List Matches "^.*\broo
# t\b.*$"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, add root user to the wheel group.
# Adding root user and other users to the wheel group:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the usermod -a -G wheel <user name> command to add users to the wheel
# group, where <user name> is user which are needed to run using su command( us
# er root is required to add).
