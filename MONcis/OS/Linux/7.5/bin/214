# targeting OS vulnerabilities.
# Rules System Configuration Files

# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /\\m|\\r|\
# \s|\\v/ System Information Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the banners to create warnings for network
# and physical access services in the /etc/motd file.
# Configuring the banners for console access in the /etc/motd file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/motd file.
# 3. Edit the file to include warning messages for network and physical access services.
# 4. Remove system information such as: \m \r \s \v from the above file if they are present
# and save the file.
# For further details, please run the command man motd to read man page.
