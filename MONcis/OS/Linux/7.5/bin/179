TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That the AIDE Package Is Installed No Results 0"
# Description Install AIDE to make use of the file integrity features to monitor critical files for changes that
# could affect the security of the system.
# Rules List of Installed Packages
# Element Equals "installed packages"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*a
# ide-\d.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) aide Package Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, install aide.
# Installing aide:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Install aide using yum command:
# yum install <aide_pakage>
# Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up
# their start up times. Set PRELINKING=no in /etc/sysconfig/prelink and run /usr/sbin/pre
# link -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus avoiding false positives from
# AIDE.
# For further details, please run the command man yum to read man page.
