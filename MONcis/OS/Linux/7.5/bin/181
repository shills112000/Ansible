TestDesc="Verify That the Mail Transfer Agent Is Configured to Local-only Mode"
# No Results 0
# Description Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming
# mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not in
# tended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process lo
# cal mail.
# Rules Check Mail Transfer Agent Mode
# Element Equals "Check Mail Transfer Agent Mode"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /.+/
# (Flags:Case insensitive) inet_interfaces Setting Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for local-only
# mode.
# Configuring Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for local-only mode:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/postfix/main.cf file.
# 3. Find the line inet_interfaces = <value>.
# 4. Set the line to inet_interfaces = localhost and save the file.
# 5. If the line is not found, add the line inet_interfaces = localhost following line to the
# RECEIVING MAIL section and save the file.
# 6. Run the /bin/systemctl restart postfix.service command to apply the change.
