TestDesc=" Verify That PermitUserEnvironment Option Is Set to no"
# No Results 0
# Description The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the ssh
# daemon.
# Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could po
# tentially allow users to bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has ssh
# executing trojan programs)
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*P
# ermitUserEnvironment[\ \t]+(\S+)[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode)
# PermitUserEnvironment Not equal "yes"
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the SSH server to disable environment pro
# cessing.
# Configuring the SSH server to disable environment processing:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
# 3. Find the line PermitUserEnvironment <value>.
# 4. Set <value> to no and save the file.
# 5. Run the service sshd restart command to restart the sshd service.
# For further details, please run the command man sshd_config to read man page.
