TestDesc=" That net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies Is Equalto 1 (Runtime Value)"
# No Results 0
# Description The system should be configured to send syn cookies when the syn backlog limit is exceed
# ed. With this parameter enabled, when the system reaches a point where the number of in
# complete TCP connections exceeds the value specified in net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog, the
# system changes the way it responds to new connection requests. Rather than remembering
# all new connections, the system will send out a coded response (the 'syncookie') and forget
# that the connection request came in at all. If the client completes the connection with a third
# ACK packet, the server will see the cookie coming back and will respond by rebuilding the
# connection in memory.

# cp_syncookies Equals 1
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set the network parameter to enable sending of syn
# cookies to help prevent syn flood attacks.
# Setting the network parameter to enable sending of syncookies to help prevent syn
# flood attacks:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/sysctl.conf file.
# 3. Find the line net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = <value>.
# 4. Set the line to net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 and save the file.
# 5. If there is no line setting net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies, add the following line:
# net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
# at the end of the file and save it.
# 6. Run the sysctl -p command to apply the change.
# For further details, please run the command man sysctl to read man page.
