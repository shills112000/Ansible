TestDesc=" Verify That SSH X11 Forwarding Is Disabled " 
# Description The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection
# to enable remote graphic connections.
# Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications di
# rectly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH
# with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even
# if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*X
# 11Forwarding[\ \t]+(\S+)[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) (SSH X11
# Forwarding Equals "no" AND SSH X11 Forwarding Setting Exists ) OR SSH X11 Forwarding
# Setting Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the SSH server to disable X11 Forwarding.
# Configuring the SSH server to disable X11 Forwarding:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
# 3. Find the line X11Forwarding <value>.
# 4. Set <value> to no and save the file.
# 5. Run the pkill -HUP sshd or /sbin/service sshd restart commands to restart the
# sshd service.
# For further details, please run the command man sshd_config to read man page.
