TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That Default Login Shell for System Accounts Is Set to /sbin/nologin"
# Description This test verifies that default login shell for system accounts is set to /sbin/nologin. It is impor
# tant to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are locked to prevent
# them from being used to provide an interactive shell and it is also recommended that the shell
# field in the password file be set to /sbin/nologin. This prevents the account from potentially be
# ing used to run any commands.
# Rules Block System Accounts
# Element Equals "System Accounts"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^User
# name=(?!(?:sync|shutdown|halt)\b)\S+[\ \t]+Id=(?:\d{0,2}|[1-4]\d{2})[\ \t]+Shell=(?!/sbin/nolo
# gin\b).*/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) System Account Setting Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set default login shell for the system accounts to /sbin/
# nologin.
# Setting the default login shell for the system accounts to /sbin/nologin:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# /bin/awk -F: '0+$3 < 500 && $1 !~ /^[[:space:]]*(#.*|root|sync|shut
# down|halt|\+.*)$/ && $7 !~ /^\/sbin\/nologin$/ {print $1}' /etc/pass
# wd 2>/dev/null
# to list all the system accounts that do not have /sbin/nologin as the default login
# shell.
# 3. For each account listed in step 2, run command the usermod -s /sbin/nologin
# <account_name> command to set default login shell for the account to /sbin/nolo
# gin.
# For further details, please run the command man usermod to read man page.
