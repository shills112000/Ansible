TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That /dev/shm Partition Is Set nosuid Option in /etc/fstab No Results 0"
# Description The nosuid mount option specifies that the /dev/shm (temporary filesystem stored in memory)
# will not execute setuid and setgid on executable programs as such, but rather execute them
# with the uid and gid of the user executing the program. Setting this option on a file system pre
# vents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users
# to execute them.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+/dev/shm[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bnosuid\b.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Com
# ments mode) /dev/shm with nosuid Option Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set nosuid option for /dev/shm partition.
# Setting nosuid option for /dev/shm partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /dev/shm.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition for
# /dev/shm, then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the nosuid option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount, nosuid /dev/shm command.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
