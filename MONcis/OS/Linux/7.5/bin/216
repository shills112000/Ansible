TestDesc="Status Severity Time World-writable Directories Should Have Their Sticky Bit Set "
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that the 'sticky bit' is set on all world-writable directories.
# When the 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a file may remove that file from the
# directory.
# Rules Check Sticky Bit Setting on World Writable Files
# Element Equals "File Permissions"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /.+/
# (Flags:Case insensitive) Sticky Bit Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set sticky bit to world-writable directories.
# Setting sticky bit to world-writable directories:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the following script:
# PARTs=`/bin/df --local -P 2>/dev/null | /bin/awk 'NR != 1 {$1="
# ";$2="";$3="";$4="";$5="";gsub("^[[:space:]]+/","/",$0);print $0}'
# 2>/dev/null`; SaveIFS=$IFS;IFS=`/bin/echo -e "\n\b"`; for PART in
# $PARTs; do /usr/bin/find "$PART" -xdev -type d \( -perm -0002 -
# a ! -perm -1000 \) -ls 2>/dev/null | /bin/awk '{a=$3; gsub("^[^/]*/",
# "/",$0); print a, $0}'; done;
# to list world-writable directories which are not set the sticky bit.
# 3. Set the sticky bit or remove write permission for other group on directories found in
# step 2 using the chmod +t <file_location> or chmod o-w <file_location> command
# respectively.
# For further details, please refer to:
