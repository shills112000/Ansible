TestDesc="Verify That System Accounts Are Locked"
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that system accounts are locked. It is important to make sure that accounts
# that are not being used by regular users are locked to prevent them from being used to pro
# vide an interactive shell and it is also recommended that the shell field in the password file
# be set to /sbin/nologin. This prevents the account from potentially being used to run any com
# mands.
# Rules Block System Accounts
# Element Equals "System Accounts"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^User
# name=\S+[\ \t]+Id=(?:\d{0,2}|[1-4]\d{2})[\ \t]+Shell=\S+[\ \t]+Account_locked=(?!LK\b).*/ (Flag
# s:Multiline,Comments mode) System Account Setting Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, lock the system accounts.
# Locking the system accounts:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# SystemAccounts=`/bin/awk -F: '0+$3 < 500 && $1 !~ /^[[:space:
# ]]*(#.*|root|\+.*)$/ {print $1}' /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null`; for Sys
# temAccount in $SystemAccounts; do Account_locked=`/usr/bin/
# passwd -S $SystemAccount 2>/dev/null | /bin/awk '$2 !~ /^LK
# $/{print $2}'`; if [ -n "$Account_locked" ]; then /bin/echo "$Sys
# temAccount"; fi; done
# to list all the system accounts that are not locked.
# 3. For each account listed in step 2, run command the usermod -L <account_name>
# command to lock the account.
# For further details, please run the command man usermod to read man page.
