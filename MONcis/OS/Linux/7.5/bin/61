TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify No UID 0 Entries Other than root No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the only account in /etc/passwd that has a UID of 0 is the 'root' account.
# Allowing non-root accounts to have a UID of 0 would let those accounts perform actions that
# only 'root' should be allowed to perform.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/passwd"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /(?:^root:[^
# \#:&&\S]*:(?!0)\d+:|^(?!root\b)[^\#:&&\S]*:[^\#:&&\S]*:0:).*/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode)
# Accounts with UID 0 Other than root Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, change UID of the root account to 0 and UIDs of others
# to not equal to 0.
# Changing UID of the root account to 0 and UIDs of others to not equal to 0:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the grep "^[[:space:]]*root" /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print$1 " has UID
# equal to "$3"."}' command to check UID of the root account.
# 3. If UID of root is not equal to 0, then run the usermod -u 0 root command to change
# UID of root to 0.
# 4. Run the grep ":0:" /etc/passwd | grep -v "^ [[:space:]]* root" | awk -F ":" '{print$1
# ":"$3":"}' | grep ":0:" command to list all accounts (except root) that have UID equal
# to 0.
# 5. Run the usermod -u <UID> <user_name> command to change UID of the above ac
# counts with <UID> is not equal to 0.
# For further details, please run the command man 5 passwd to read man page.
