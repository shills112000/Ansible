TestDesc=" Status Severity Time Verify That 'nodev' Option Is Added to /dev/shm Partition in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices. Since
# the /dev/shm filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users
# cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /dev/shm.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+/dev/shm[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]*\bnodev\b.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Com
# ments mode) Right Configuration Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set nodev option for /dev/shm partition.
# Setting nodev option for /dev/shm partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /dev/shm.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition for
# /dev/shm, then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the nodev option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount,nodev /dev/shm command.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
