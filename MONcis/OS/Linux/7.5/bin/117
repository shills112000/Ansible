TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That a /var Partition Is in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynam
# ic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable. Creating a sepa
# rate partition for /var avoids a risk of resource exhaustion.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[^\#\n]*[\
# \t]+/var[\ \t]+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /var Entry Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, create a separate partition for /var.
# Creating a separate partition for /var:
# 1. For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create
# a separate partition for /var.
# 2. For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
# to create partitions.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
