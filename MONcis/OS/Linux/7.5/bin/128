# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that /etc/audit/audit.rules contains the '-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale'
# option.
# It is important to maintain an audit trail in order to thoroughly track and analyze system activity
# when something goes wrong.

# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the system to audit events that modify the
# system's network environment.
# Configuring the system to audit events that modify the system's network environment
# on RHEL 5, 6:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/audit/audit.rules file.
# 3. Find the line that contains the -w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale entry.
# 4. Uncomment that line or add if not found and save the file.
# 5. Run the service auditd restart command to apply the change.
