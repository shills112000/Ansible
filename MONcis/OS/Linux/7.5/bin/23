TestDesc="Status Severity Time For 64 Bit Architecture: Verify That audit Log ging Is Enabled to Log Events of clock_settime() Functions No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that /etc/audit/audit.rules contains the '-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock
# _settime -k time-change' option.
# It is important to maintain an audit trail in order to thoroughly track and analyze system activity
# when something goes wrong.
# Rules Audit Rules for 64 bits Architecture

# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^[\ ]*

# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, configure the system to audit events that modify sys
# tem date and/or time.
# Configuring the system to audit events that modify system date and/or time on RHEL 5,
# 6:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/audit/audit.rules file.
# 3. Find the line that contains the -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -k timechange
# entry.
# 4. Uncomment that line or add it to the end of file (if not found) then save the file.
# 5. Run the service auditd restart command to apply the change.
# Configuring the system to audit events that modify system date and/or time on RHEL 7:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules file.
# 3. Find the line that contains the -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -k timechange
# entry.
# 4. Uncomment that line or add it to the end of file (if not found) then save the file.
# 5. Run the service auditd restart command to apply the change.
# Note: This configuration only applies to 64 bits architecture.
