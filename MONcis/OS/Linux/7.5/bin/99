TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That Password Hashing Algorithm Is Upgraded to SHA-512 No Results 0"
# Description The SHA-512 encryption has been available since Red Hat release 5.2,. The commands be
# low change password encryption from md5 to sha512 ( a much stronger hashing algorithm).
# All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to upgrade the stored hashes to
# the new algorithm.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/sysconfig/authconfig"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^PASS
# WDALGORITHM=sha512[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) PASSWDALGORITHM
# Setting Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, upgrading password hashing algorithm to SHA-512.
# Upgrading password hashing algorithm to SHA-512:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the authconfig --passalgo=sha512 --update command to upgrade password
# hashing algorithm to SHA-512.
# 3. Run the following command to force users to change their passwords on next login:
# awk -F: '(0+$3 >=500 && $1 != "nfsnobody" ) { print $1 }' /etc/pass
# wd | xargs -n 1 chage -d 0
# For further details, please run the command man authconfig to read man page.
