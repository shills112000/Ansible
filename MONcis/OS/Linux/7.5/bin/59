TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify Home Directories Ownership No Results 0"
# Description This test checks that all home directories are owned by the user associated with them.
# In conjunction with proper permissions, correct ownership prevents unauthorized change.
# Rules User Home Directories
# Element Equals "User Home Directories"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Pass Regular expression: /^User
# Name=(?!nfsnobody[\ \t])\S+[\ \t]+UserID=([1-9]\d{3}|0*\d{5,})[\ \t]+.*Owner=(?!\1[\ \t])\S+[\

# Deviation Does not exist
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set appropriate ownership on the home directory of
# each account.
# Setting appropriate ownership on the home directory of each account:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the script:
# Users=`/bin/cat /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null | /bin/egrep -v "^[[:space
# :]]*(#.*|\+.*|nfsnobody):" | /bin/awk -F: '$3 >=1000 {print}'`; IFS=`
# /bin/echo -en "\n\b"`; SavedIFS="$IFS"; IFS=`/bin/echo -en "\n
# \b"`; for User in $Users; do UserAcct=`/bin/echo $User | /bin/cut
# -d":" -f1`; UserHome=`/bin/echo $User | /bin/cut -d":" -f6`; if [ -
# d "$UserHome" ] && [ "$UserHome" != "/" ]; then Owner=`/usr/
# bin/stat -c %U $UserHome 2>/dev/null`;if [ "$Owner" != "$UserAc
# ct" ]; then /bin/echo -e "The [ $UserAcct ] user has [ $UserHome ]
# home directory with invalid ownership of [ $Owner ]";fi;fi;done
# ;IFS="$SavedIFS"
# to list users of which home directory is not owned by the assigned user except the "/"
# directory.
# 3. For each user found in step 2, run the chown <assigned_user> <home_dir_locat
# ion> command to set owner of the home directory to the assigned user.
# Note: If the script output returns a local account that duplicate name with others, recommend
# that you should remove or comment it out.
