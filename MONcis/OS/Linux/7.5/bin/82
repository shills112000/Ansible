TestDesc="Status Severity Time# Verify That /home Partition Mounted with 'nodev' No Results 0"
# Description The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices. Since
# the /home filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users
# cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /home.
# Rules File Systems Mounted
# Element Equals "File Systems Mounted"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*[
# ^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+on[\ \t]+/home[\ \t]+type[\ \t]+[^\#&&\S]+[\ \t]+\([^\#&&\S]*\bnodev\b.*\).*$/ (Flag
# s:Multiline,Comments mode) /home with nodev Option Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set nodev option for /home partition.
# Setting nodev option for /home partition:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/fstab file.
# 3. Find the line with options for /home.
# 4. If not found, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a separate partition for
# /home, then go to step 5.
# 5. If found, add the nodev option to the fourth field, using a comma to separate from
# other options.
# 6. Remount partition by using the mount -o remount,nodev /home command.
