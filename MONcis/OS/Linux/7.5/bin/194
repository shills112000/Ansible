TestDesc=" Verify That the fs.suid_dumpable Parameter Is Set to 0"
# Set to 0
# No Results 0
# Description This test verify That fs.suid_dumpable is set to 0. When suid_dumpable is set to 0, a core
# dump will not be produced for a process which has changed credentials (by calling seteuid(2),
# setgid(2), or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary
# does not have read permission enabled.

# proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable[\ \t]*:[\ \t]*(\d+)[\ \t]*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) fs.suid_du
# mpable Equals 0
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, set fs.suid.dumpable to disable core dumps in order to
# prevent suid programs from dumping core.
# Setting fs.suid_dumpable to disable core dumps:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Open the /etc/sysctl.conf file.
# 3. Find the lines fs.suid_dumpable = <value>.
# 4. Set the <value> to 0 and save the file.
# 5. If there no line setting fs.suid_dumplable, add the following line:
# fs.suid_dumpable = 0
# at the end of the file and save the file.
# 6. Run the sysctl -p command to apply the change.
# For further details, please run the command man sysctl.conf to read man page.
