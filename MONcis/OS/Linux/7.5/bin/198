# Description This test verifies that rsyslog package is installed on the system. The security enhancements
# of rsyslog such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to
# database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server) justify
# installing and configuring the package.
