TestDesc=" Status Severity Time Verify That the System Is Configured to Use an NTP Server No Results 0"
# Description This test verifies that the system clock is synchronized to a trusted time source. Synchronizing
# with an NTP server makes it possible to collate system logs from multiple sources or correlate
# computer events with real time events. Using a trusted NTP server provided by your organiza
# tion is recommended.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/ntp.conf"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[\ \t]*s
# erver[\ \t]+\S+$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) server Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, config the server for the NTP to synchronize system
# clock:
# Config the server for the NTP to synchronize system clock:
# 1. Become super user or equivalent roles
# 2. Open /etc/ntp.conf file
# 3. Add the following line:
# server <ntp-server>
# <ntp-server>
# 4. Save and close the file
