TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That a /home Partition Is in the /etc/fstab File No Results 0"
# Description The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users. If the system is in
# tended to support local users, create a separate partition for the /home directory to protect
# against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be stored under /home.
# Rules System Configuration Files
# Element Equals "/etc/fstab"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /^[^\#\n]*[\
# \t]+/home[\ \t]+.*$/ (Flags:Multiline,Comments mode) /home Entry Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, create separate a partition for /home.
# Creating a separate partition for /home:
# 1. For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create
# a separate partition for /home.
# 2. For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
# to create partitions.
# For further details, see the guidance on the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for more informa
# tion on repartitioning filesystems:
