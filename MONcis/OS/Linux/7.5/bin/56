TestDesc="Verify Boot Loader Password Settings"
# No Results 0
# Description This test verifies that a password is required when a user attempts to modify the boot process
# by passing commands to GRUB.
# If a password is not required an attacker might be able to subvert the normal boot process on
# the server.
# Rules Get Super Users Setting in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg File
# Element Equals "Get Super Users Setting in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg File"
# Version conditions If an element version has no content, the condition should:Fail Regular expression: /.+/ (Flag
# s:Multiline,Case insensitive,Comments mode) Super User with Assigned Password Exists
# Remediation To remediate failure of this policy test, add and setup encrypted password for at least one su
# peruser in /etc/grub.d/00_header file.
# Adding and setting up encrypted password for superuser in /etc/grub.d/00_header file:
# 1. Become superuser or assume an equivalent role.
# 2. Run the /bin/grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command to generate the encryption pass
# word of super users.
# 3. Open the /etc/grub.d/00_header file.
# 4. Find the line set superusers="user1 user2 ...".
# 5. If not found add the following section to the file to add super users:
# cat << EOF
# set superusers="user1 user2 ..."
# EOF
# 6. Setting encryption password for superuser:
# • Copy the encryption password of super user from step 2.
# • Add the password_pbkdf2 <username> <encryption password> line right
# after the line set superusers="user1 user2 ...".
# 7. Run the grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg command to apply the change.
