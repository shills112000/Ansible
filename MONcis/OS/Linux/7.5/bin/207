TestDesc="Status Severity Time Verify That the ypbind Package Is Removed No Results 0"
# Description The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-serv
# er directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client (yp
# bind) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration
# files. The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS at
# tacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
# been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is rec
# ommended that the service be removed.
